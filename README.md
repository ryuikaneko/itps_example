# iTPS/iPEPS example

- based on https://github.com/TsuyoshiOkubo/pTNS
- works only for Python 2
- ground-state and time-evolution calculations in the Bose-Hubbard model and the quantum Ising model
- to reduce the computational cost in the time-evolution calculation, first output time-dependent wave functions, and then calculate physical quantities for selected time steps
